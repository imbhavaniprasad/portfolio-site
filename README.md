This is a a Portfolio Site, Built using HTML,CSS & JS.
I really enjoyed a lot while building this since it's been many years since I fully worked on creating a site using pure html,css&js. 
For the past few years I addicted to frameworks such as bootstrap or mui (for react apps), so when I was using css cute properties, I felt so nostalgic & super happy;
Here in the project, You can see cool things such as hover effect on cards,making site responsive,creating a working form which can actually send the entered data to your google sheets absolutely for free.
